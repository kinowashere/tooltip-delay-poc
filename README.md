# Tooltip delay issues

Tooltip has an issue on mobile devices where, if you have a `Tooltip` component and it is open while you scroll, the `Content` has a delay catching up to the `Trigger`'s position.

# Requirements

Install `pnpm`, do `pnpm install` and run `pnpm dev`. Use a **real smartphone** device to test it out, Ngrok may help.
